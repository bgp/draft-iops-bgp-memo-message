   Authors' Addresses

1.  Introduction

   This document defines the BGP-4 [RFC4271] ADVISORY Message and
   Support for ADVISORY Message Capability to facilitate the exchange of
   human-oriented information specific to the BGP session through which
   the ADVISORY message is transmitted.  ADVISORY messages are intended
   to aid root cause analysis and bootstrapping of out-of-band
   communication between operators by allowing them to signal key
   information over the known (and potentially trusted) in-band
   communication channel that is an existing BGP session.

2.  Protocol Extensions

   The BGP protocol extensions introduced in this document include the
   definition of a new BGP capability, named "Support for ADVISORY
   Message Capability", and the specification of the ADVISORY message.

2.1.  Support for ADVISORY Message Capability

   The "Support for ADVISORY Message Capability" is a new BGP capability
   [RFC5492].  The Length field of this capability MUST be set to 1.
   The Capability value MUST be set to the highest version of the
   ADVISORY message supported by the BGP speaker.  This document only
   defines ADVISORY version 1 messages.

   By advertising this capability to a peer, a BGP speaker conveys to
   the peer that the speaker supports receiving ADVISORY messages,
   indicates what version of the ADVISORY message it supports, and
   indicates that it supports the related procedures described in this
   document.

2.2.  ADVISORY Message

   An ADVISORY message is composed of an optional NOTICE, and optionally
   one or more ADVISE key-value pairs.  An ADVISORY message MUST NOT
   contain more than 16 ADVISE key-value pairs.  Each key and each value
   field MUST be preceded by a 1 octet Length field to indicate the
   length of the subsequent field.  ADVISE key fields have a REQUIRED
   maximum length of 32 octets.  ADVISE value fields have a REQUIRED
   maximum length of 128 octets.  To support international characters,
   all string fields MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  Fields are not NUL
   terminated.  There is no significance to the order of key-value
   pairs.

   In concept, ADVISE data is similar to the dissemination of plan
   files.  When sending a new ADVISORY message to transmit a new NOTICE,
   the sender MUST repeat all configured ADVISE data.  Phrased
   differently: a new ADVISORY message completely replaces any prior
   ADVISORY message.

   A zero-length ADVISORY message can be send to clear any ADVISORY
   information on the remote side.

   /           ... additional ADVISE key-value pairs ...           /

   N-Length:  This 8-bit field represents the length of the NOTICE
      payload field in octets.  The length value MUST range from 0 to
      128 inclusive.  When the length value is zero, no NOTICE payload
      field follows.

   NOTICE payload:  UTF-8, up to 128 octets.

   ADVISE K-len:  This 8-bit field represents the length of the next
      ADVISE key field in octets.  The length value MUST range from 0 to
      32 inclusive.

   ADVISE key:  ADVISE key, UTF-8, up to 32 octets.

   ADIVSE V-len:  This 8-bit field represents the length of the
      following ADVISE value field for this key, in octets.  The length
      value MUST range from 0 to 32 inclusive.

   ADVISE value:  ADVISE value for this key, UTF-8, up to 128 octets.

   Each ADVISORY message contains either no NOTICE payload, or a single
   NOTICE payload.  Optionally, up to 16 ADVISE key-value pairs can be
   encoded in the ADVISORY message.

2.2.1.  Note on UTF-8

   To support international characters, fields MUST be encoded using
   UTF-8.  A receiving BGP speaker MUST NOT interpret invalid UTF-8
   sequences.  Note that when a field contains multibyte characters, the
   number of characters will be less than the length value.  Fields are
   not NUL terminated.

3.  Operational Considerations

3.1.  CLI / UI Mock-up - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section is not meant to drive UI design decisions, but rather as
   scaffold to further discussion.

   Notice that ADVISORY NOTICE and SHUTDOWN COMMUNICATION messages are
   brought together in the same view for a coherent storyline.

4.  Error Handling

   The following section assumes HARD error failure, but another option
   is to fail softly.  For WG discussion.

   This document defines a new NOTIFICATION error code: "ADVISORY
   Message Error".  The following new error subcodes are defined:

             +--------------------------------------+-------+
             | name                                 | value |
             +--------------------------------------+-------+
             | Invalid ADVISORY Message Length      |  TBD  |
             | Invalid ADVISORY NOTICE Length       |  TBD  |
             | Invalid ADVISORY ADVISE Key Length   |  TBD  |
             | Invalid ADVISORY ADVISE Value Length |  TBD  |
             +--------------------------------------+-------+

                 Table 1: ADVISORY Message Error subcodes

   The error handling specified in this section is applicable only when
   a BGP speaker has received the "Support for ADVISORY Message
   Capability" from a peer.

   All errors detected while processing the ADVISORY message MUST be
   indicated by sending the NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code
   ADVISORY Message Error.  The error subcode elaborates on the specific
   nature of the error.

   A zero-length ADVISORY message MUST NOT be considered malformed.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign value TBD1 (ADVISORY) in the "BGP Message
   Types" subregistry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   Parameters" registry.

   IANA is requested to assign value TBD2 (ADVISORY Message Error) in
   the "BGP Error (Notification) Codes" subregistry under the "Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" registry.

   IANA is requested to create a new registry "ADVISORY Message Error
   subcodes" for error subcodes, under the "BGP Error Subcodes"
   subregistry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters"
   registry.  The Registration Procedure for this new registry is "First
   Come First Served".  IANA is requested to assign and register the
   values from Table 1 in this new error subcode registry.

   IANA is requested to assign value TBD4 (Support for ADVISORY Message
   Capability) in the "Capability Codes" registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   This specification uses UTF-8 encoding for certain fields of the
   ADVISORY message.  Implementers would do well to incorporate
   recommendations from UNICODE TR36 [UTR36].

   Use of this protocol enhancement has the same security considerations
   as [I-D.ietf-idr-shutdown].
